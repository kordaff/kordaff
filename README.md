PS  Is it me or is it stupid to add a readme that says almost exactly what my bio blurb does?
    I haven't written anything new using bootstrap/jquery/jquery-ui for quite a while...
    
    I did tweak a bit of 22 yr old Perl code I wrote that spews out a povray file for a 3D maze.
    That originated in the 6510 code I wrote from an algorithm in Basic program in a Compute!
    magazine that made a single-path/space-filling 2D maze.
